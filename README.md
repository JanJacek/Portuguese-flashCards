# ProtugalFlashCards (flashcards)

This is a 100% free program to learn the most important Portuguese words.
I hope that the project will develop into a full-fledged application
for learning this language.
If you want to help in the development of the application,
feel free to add suggestions and new features.
Please remember to use only legal and free sources.
